I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.ccnu.edu.cn/) at [Central China Normal University](https://english.ccnu.edu.cn/) (CCNU) since 2025. My research lies at the intersection of theoretical computer science and economics. In particular, I am interested in problems related to game theory, mechanism design and contract theory. Recently, I am also interested in online learning theory.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2024, where I worked in the [Algorithms and Logic Lab](https://tcsuestc.com/) under the supervision of [Mingyu Xiao](https://sites.google.com/site/myxiao/). I also obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees there in Information and Communication Engineering. From 2022 to 2023, I was a visiting student at the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, hosted by [Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/). After completing my Ph.D. in 2024, I worked as a visiting scholar at the Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, hosted by [Yiding Feng](https://www.ydfeng.us/).
