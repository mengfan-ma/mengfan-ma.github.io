I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at [Central China Normal University](https://english.ccnu.edu.cn/) (CCNU) since 2025. My research lies at the intersection of theoretical computer science and economics. In particular, I am interested in problems related to game theory, mechanism design, and contract theory. More recently, my research has also extended to online learning theory.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC) in 2024, where I worked in the [Algorithms and Logic Lab](https://tcsuestc.com/) under the supervision of Prof. [Mingyu Xiao](https://sites.google.com/site/myxiao/). I also obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from the School of Information and Communication Engineering at UESTC. From 2022 to 2023, I was a visiting student at the [Institute for Theoretical Computer Science](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/) at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, hosted by Prof. [Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/). After completing my Ph.D. in 2024, I worked as a visiting scholar in the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics](https://ieda.ust.hk/eng/index.php) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, hosted by Prof. [Yiding Feng](https://www.ydfeng.us/).
