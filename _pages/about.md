I am an assistant professor in the Department of Economics at the [Central China Normal University](https://english.ccnu.edu.cn/) (CCNU) since 2025. My research lies in the intersection of theoretical computer science and economics, which also know as *algorithmic game theory*. In particular, I am interested in problems related to mechanism design, contract theory and online learning.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2024, from the [Algorithms and Logic Lab](https://tcsuestc.com/), supervised by [Mingyu Xiao](https://sites.google.com/site/myxiao/). I also obtained Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees there in Information and Communication Engineering. I was a visiting student at the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics from 2022 to 2023, hosted by [Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/). After Phd graduation in 2024, I conducted visiting research at the Department of Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, hosted by [Yiding Feng](https://www.ydfeng.us/).
